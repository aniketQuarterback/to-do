Features
Add Task: Users can add new tasks by entering task descriptions in the input field and clicking the "Add" button.
Delete Task: Users can delete individual tasks by clicking the "Delete" button next to each task.
Mark Task as Done: Users can mark tasks as completed by clicking the "Done" button next to each task. Completed tasks will be displayed with a strikethrough.
Filter Tasks:
All Tasks: View all tasks.
Pending Tasks: View tasks that are not completed.
Completed Tasks: View tasks that are marked as completed.
Delete All Tasks: Users can delete all tasks at once by clicking the "Delete All" button.
Delete Selected Tasks: Users can delete all completed tasks at once by clicking the "Delete Selected" button.

////
Application Architecture
The application consists of three main components:

HTML: Defines the structure of the application user interface (UI) including input fields, buttons, task lists, and filters.
CSS: Provides styles for the HTML elements, ensuring a visually appealing and responsive layout.
JavaScript: Implements the application logic, handling task management (add, delete, mark as done), event listeners for user interactions, and task filtering.
HTML Structure
The HTML file (index.html) defines the structure of the application:

Header Section: Contains the application title, input field to add new tasks, and "Add" button.
Task List: Displays the list of tasks added by the user, with options to mark as done or delete individual tasks.
Filters: Allows users to filter tasks by all, pending, or completed.
CSS Styling
The CSS file (todo.css) provides styles for various components of the application:

Defines global styles for fonts, box-sizing, and scrollbar.
Styles specific components such as the main container, header, input section, task list, buttons, and filters.
Implements responsive design using media queries to ensure optimal display on different screen sizes.
JavaScript Functionality
The JavaScript file (todo.js) implements the core functionality of the application:

Task Management Functions: Includes functions to add new tasks (add), delete individual tasks (deleteTodo), mark tasks as completed (completeTodo), and delete all tasks (deleteAll and deleteS).
Event Listeners: Listens for user interactions such as button clicks and keypress events to trigger corresponding actions (e.g., adding a new task, deleting a task, marking a task as done).
Task Filtering: Implements functions (viewAll, viewRemaining, viewCompleted) to filter and display tasks based on their completion status.
////
Usage
To use the To-Do List application:

Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Enter a task description in the input field.
Click the "Add" button to add the task to the list.
Interact with the task list buttons to mark tasks as done, delete individual tasks, or filter tasks based on completion status.
Use the filter dropdown to switch between viewing all, pending, or completed tasks.
Use the "Delete All" button to delete all tasks, or "Delete Selected" button to delete all completed tasks.

Comprehensive Documentation for To-Do List Application
Overview
The To-Do List application is designed to help users manage tasks effectively through a web-based interface. This documentation aims to provide a detailed explanation of the application's features, architecture, and code implementation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Features
Add Task:

Functionality: Allows users to add new tasks by entering task descriptions in the input field and clicking the "Add" button.
Implementation (todo.js):
javascript
Copy code
function add() {
    var value = todoInput.value;
    if (value === '') {
        alert("ðŸ˜® Task cannot be empty")
        return;
    }
    todoList.push({
        task: value,
        id: Date.now().toString(),
        complete: false,
    });
    todoInput.value = "";
    update();
    addinmain(todoList);
}
Explanation: When the user clicks the "Add" button or presses Enter after entering a task description, the add function is triggered. It retrieves the task description from the input field (todoInput.value), checks if the input is not empty, adds the task to the todoList array as an object with a unique ID and completion status (complete: false), updates the task counts (update function), and refreshes the displayed task list (addinmain function).
Delete Task:

Functionality: Enables users to delete individual tasks by clicking the "Delete" button next to each task.
Implementation (todo.js):
javascript
Copy code
function deleteTodo(e) {
    var deleted = e.target.parentElement.parentElement.getAttribute('id');
    todoList = todoList.filter((ele) => {
        return ele.id != deleted
    })
    update();
    addinmain(todoList);
}
Explanation: The deleteTodo function is triggered when the user clicks the "Delete" button associated with a task. It retrieves the unique ID of the task to be deleted (deleted) from the HTML element, filters the todoList array to remove the task with the matching ID, updates the task counts, and refreshes the displayed task list.
Mark Task as Done:

Functionality: Allows users to mark tasks as completed by clicking the "Done" button next to each task, which displays completed tasks with a strikethrough.
Implementation (todo.js):
javascript
Copy code
function completeTodo(e) {
    var completed = e.target.parentElement.parentElement.getAttribute('id');
    todoList.forEach((obj) => {
        if (obj.id == completed) {
            obj.complete = !obj.complete;
            var taskElement = e.target.parentElement.parentElement.querySelector("#task");
            taskElement.classList.toggle("line", obj.complete);
        }
    })
    update();
    addinmain(todoList);
}
Explanation: The completeTodo function toggles the completion status (complete: true/false) of the task associated with the clicked "Done" button. It updates the CSS
